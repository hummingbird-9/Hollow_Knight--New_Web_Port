The diff. between the optimized and non optimized is mainly visuals. If your chromebook or other device can't handle the normal version well, use the optimized version. The only caveat is that the optimized version won't look as sharp. It still looks good, though. The reason the optimized doesn't look as sharp is because it has a set resolution at 1080p (devicePixelRatio is set to 1), and many sounds and moving objects have been compressed or frozen except when necessary.
